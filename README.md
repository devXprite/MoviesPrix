## About
This website is built using Next.js 13 and use TMDB API to fetch movie and TV serial data.

On this website, users can search for and explore movies and TV serials, as well as bookmark their favorites for easy access later. This website is also fully responsive, so it can be easily accessed and used on any device, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

To get started, you will need to obtain an API key from TMDB by creating an account on their website (https://www.themoviedb.org/). Once you have your API key, you can set it as an environment variable.

1. Clone repository using git clone

    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
    cd MoviesPrix
    ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Get your TMDB API key from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and set it as an environment variable in `.env` file
   ```bash
    TMDB_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
    ```
